# Chapter 1: introduction and updates
hi, choke here

i will continue to keep my services online (some of these services have limited functionality)
- the wubby wiki
- `wubbygame.com`
- any service related to `wubbygame.com`

will stop interacting with the **wubby community** unless kory actually hires a very much needed community manager

# Chapter 2: the ranting part
long story short i was banned from the wubby discord server because of a group chat server with no connection to wubby whatsoever
- i poorly worded to why the server was closed (in this case i labeled it as a "porn dump")
- the server was full of minors, yes, including me (`_choke`)

like what the fuck?? its literally none of your business

not to mention [iconic](https://discord.com/users/583110584288018467) and [fireflanger](https://discord.com/users/228672475343355905) sharing shit to blockate staff

i am not going to fucking get my friends banned on blockate because of this shit

---

also regarding fireflanger, i love how he went online daily trying to figure out the contents of the group chat server
then proceeds to go inactive after i get banned

---

and also iconic doing what seems like a fucking ban speedrun from the blockate discord server

# Chapter 3: why some services have limited functionality
- kory removed my access to wubby [datastores](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud-services/datastores), hence why the [wubby api](https://api.wubbygame.com/docs) is non-functional
- still angry that two wubby mods were going to ban me for reasons stated in chapter 2

will update this page when i remember more shit
