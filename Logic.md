## {.tabset}

### AND Gate
if all inputs are **true**, then it will give an output. But if only ONE of the inputs is false, there will be no output.

### OR Gate
only one or more **true** inputs is needed to give an output, if all of the inputs are false there will be no output.

### NOT Gate
if NONE of the inputs are **true**, then there will be an output. if ONE or MORE of the inputs are true, then there will be an output.
