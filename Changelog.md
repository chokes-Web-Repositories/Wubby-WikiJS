# 2022
## December
### December 6
```diff
+ added around 12 blocks
+ added an special category
+ added multiple block transform tool
+ added a new way to select brickcolors
+ if you attach the properties gui to one side of the screen, the undo and redo button and the grid size panel will go to the other side

* changed how spheres work so now they resize in a custom way
* changed a bit how blocks are displayed to allow search in the future
* made undo and redo button a bit smaller
* changed overall the size of the gui so it fits bigger screens better

- fixed a bug that somehow broke setnetworkserver and hidetextures properties
- fixed some lag issues
- fixed a bug in which blocks wouldn't load when trying to load in
```

### December 7
```diff
+ added search bar for block search
+ added search bar for enum search
+ selected enum by default will highlight

* fixed how the enum selector works so it's less prone to breaking
* replaced some things around
* turned most of the gui into scale so it fits better in larger and smaller devices

- fixed a bug related to the transform tool not closing correctly
- fixed resize resizing in a weird way
- fixed move tool so it now goes in the right way
- fixed a really important bug in which blocks affected by the transform tool would continue being cancollide off after turned off
- fixed a bug in which the selection box would not clear correctly
```

### December 8
```diff
+ added z, x and c keybinds to select modes in the transform tool
+ holding ctrl while clicking on an already selected part will deselect it
+ added text block

* changed how building and editing works for future compatability with wiring (a bit broken, will fix tomorrow)
* changed some variable settings so they're more precise

- fixed resize from doing pretty weird stuff
- resize will no longer turn a part into a thin piece of paper and move it in a weird way at the same time
- multiple selection no longer selects already selected blocks
- the transform tool no longer makes really big jumps between grabs
- move tool has been fixed so now every part follows the main part instead of its own axis
- fixed a bug in which the selection would not recognize clicks sometimes
- fixed a major bug in which every single gui turned off when the player died
- removed some useless lines of codes so the game runs with less lag
```

### December 9
```diff
+ added font choosing enum
+ added floating text block
+ added burger block
+ added ketchup block
+ added "secret" category

- same applies to redo
- fixed a bug in which the enum face select screen would not work for no reason whatsoever

+when you focus on one block with the disconnect tool the lines that do not correspond with that block (aka connected to another block and not connected to that block) will get transparent (wiring indicators too) to avoid confusion and increase clarity
+wiring lines now curve more

*changed a bit how wiring works so now when you disconnect something the game makes sure to not power those again until they're powered again
