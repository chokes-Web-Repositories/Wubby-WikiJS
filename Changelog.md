# 2022
## December
### December 6
```diff
+ added around 12 blocks
+ added an special category
+ added multiple block transform tool
+ added a new way to select brickcolors
+ if you attach the properties gui to one side of the screen, the undo and redo button and the grid size panel will go to the other side

* changed how spheres work so now they resize in a custom way
* changed a bit how blocks are displayed to allow search in the future
* made undo and redo button a bit smaller
* changed overall the size of the gui so it fits bigger screens better

- fixed a bug that somehow broke setnetworkserver and hidetextures properties
- fixed some lag issues
- fixed a bug in which blocks wouldn't load when trying to load in
```

### December 7
```diff
+ added search bar for block search
+ added search bar for enum search
+ selected enum by default will highlight

* fixed how the enum selector works so it's less prone to breaking
* replaced some things around
* turned most of the gui into scale so it fits better in larger and smaller devices

- fixed a bug related to the transform tool not closing correctly
- fixed resize resizing in a weird way
- fixed move tool so it now goes in the right way
- fixed a really important bug in which blocks affected by the transform tool would continue being cancollide off after turned off
- fixed a bug in which the selection box would not clear correctly
```

### December 8
```diff
+ added z, x and c keybinds to select modes in the transform tool
+ holding ctrl while clicking on an already selected part will deselect it
+ added text block

* changed how building and editing works for future compatability with wiring (a bit broken, will fix tomorrow)
* changed some variable settings so they're more precise

- fixed resize from doing pretty weird stuff
- resize will no longer turn a part into a thin piece of paper and move it in a weird way at the same time
- multiple selection no longer selects already selected blocks
- the transform tool no longer makes really big jumps between grabs
- move tool has been fixed so now every part follows the main part instead of its own axis
- fixed a bug in which the selection would not recognize clicks sometimes
- fixed a major bug in which every single gui turned off when the player died
- removed some useless lines of codes so the game runs with less lag
```
