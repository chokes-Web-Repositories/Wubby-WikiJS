There are currently **6 types** of zones in Wubby, and 4 types of actions that can be done on said zones.

We will go in-depth on each and every one of these.

## Build Zone

The build zone allows you to **whitelist specific users** so they can **build in the area.** 
You cannot build outside the area.

> This can be useful for plot building games or allowing users to edit specific parts of your world.

## Sound Zone

The sound zone allows you to play sounds in specific regions, and only inside that region. If anyone enters the area, they will hear the sound, until they go outside.
You can change the playback speed and the volume, which essentially allows you to speed up or slow down the song, and louden it or quieten it. 
> This zone can be used for ambience in areas, a forest or a sewer, for example.
